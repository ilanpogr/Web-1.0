            <p>
                <u>Jerry Smith</u> - Summer and Morty's insecure father, Beth's husband, and Rick's son-in-law,
                who strongly disapproves of Rick's influence over his family.
                Jerry used to work at a low-level advertising agency until he was fired for incompetence.
                Jerry always tries to think of the best interest of the family, but his attempt to be the
                patriarch
                of the family can often be misguided by his self-centered nature. This causes him a great deal
                of
                conflict with Rick, as his father-in-law clearly has no respect for him whatsoever.
                his marriage is sometimes jeopardized by his wife's reactions to his poor relationship with
                Rick.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jerry can sometimes become misguided by his insecurities. He frequently battles with bouts of
                insecurity and jealousy, being constantly reminded that his marriage is on rocky terms.
                He also has a habit of quitting when things get too difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jerry loves his son Morty and only wishes for his success, academically and romantically. <br/>
                Jerry is often shown jealous of the time Morty spends with Rick at one point even
                apologizing that he is not as smart as Rick.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Morty seems aware of his father's faults, he loves Jerry in return.
                In Something Ricked This Way Comes, <br/> Morty fully admits that while Jerry isn't as smart as
                Rick,
                he states that Jerry is genius at being his dad which causes Jerry to smile.

            <h2>What are the Reasons people don't like others?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="like_paragraph">
            there are many reasons... lets look at some of them:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Listening skills:</b> Or the lack thereof. Nothing is more irritating than someone who doesn’t
                    even
                    make the
                    effort to listen to what the other person is saying.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <b>Deep pockets and short arms:</b> Generosity is a wonderful quality, but its opposite is notably
                    disliked. If you’re always keen to avoid paying your way, then chances are that people have noticed
                    this
                    trait of yours and word has gotten around that you can be stingy.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <b>Critical condition:</b> Some people really have no filter and are so quick to criticize those
                    around
                    them. If this is you, it could be one of the reasons why some people seem to be giving you a wide
                    berth.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <b>Silence ain’t always golden:</b> Sometimes it’s not what you say that might be leading people not
                    to
                    like you, but rather what you don’t say. “Thank you,” “well done,” “I love you,” “tastes great,”
                    “how are you?”<br/>
                    these are all polite and caring day-to-day expressions that people expect to hear.
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li>
                    <b>The empty vessel:</b> Uninterested people just aren’t very interesting. Someone who does nothing
                    but
                    watch soap operas, lie on the couch and read trashy magazines can be a real drag to be around.
                </li>
                <br/>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            of course there are many more <u>but this is not the point</u>.

    <h1>Q&A</h1>
    <br/>
    <div class="QA_one">
        <h2><u>What is the difference between WEB 1.0, WEB 2.0 and WEB 3.0?</u></h2>
        <p>
            Before we can unswer that, we first of all need to understand what happend in each of those
            generations.<br/>
            We'll start from explaining each web version for it self, and than the main bullets of this version.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Web 1.0 - </h3>
        <p>
            It is the "readable" phrase of the World Wide Web with flat data. In Web 1.0, there is only limited
            interaction between sites and web users.<br/>
            Web 1.0 is simply an information portal where users passively receive information without being
            given the opportunity to post reviews, comments, and feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Four design essentials of a Web 1.0 site include:</b><br/>
        <ol>
            <li>Static pages.</li>
            <li>Content is served from the servers file-system.</li>
            <li>Pages built using Server Side Includes or Common Gateway Interface (CGI).</li>
            <li>Frames and Tables used to position and align the elements on a page.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Web 2.0 - </h3>
        <p>
            It is the "writable" phrase of the World Wide Web with interactive data. Unlike Web 1.0, Web 2.0
            facilitates interaction between web users and sites, <br/>
            so it allows users to interact more freely with each other. Web 2.0 encourages participation,
            collaboration, and information sharing.<br/>
            Examples of Web 2.0 applications are Youtube, Wiki, Flickr, Facebook, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Five major features of Web 2.0: </b><br/>
        <ol>
            <li>Free sorting of information, permits users to retrieve and classify the information
                collectively.
            </li>
            <li>Dynamic content that is responsive to user input.</li>
            <li>Information flows between site owner and site users by means of evaluation & online
                commenting.
            </li>
            <li>Developed APIs to allow self-usage, such as by a software application.</li>
            <li>Web access leads to concern different, from the traditional Internet user base to a wider
                variety of users.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>Usage:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Social networking</li>
            <li>Podcasting</li>
            <li>Blogging</li>
            <li>Tagging</li>
            <li>Social media</li>
            <li>Web content voting</li>
            <li>Curating with RSS</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Web 3.0: </h3>
        <p>
            It is the "executable" phrase of Word Wide Web with dynamic applications, interactive services, and
            "machine-to-machine" interaction. Web 3.0 is a semantic web which refers to the future.<br/>
            In Web 3.0, computers can interpret information like humans and intelligently generate and distribute
            useful
            content tailored to the needs of users.<br/>
            One example of Web 3.0 is Tivo, a digital video recorder. Its recording program can search the web and
            read what it finds to you based on your preferences.
        <p>
            <b>5 main features that can help us define Web 3.0: </b><br/>
        <ol>
            <li>Semantic Web</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence - Combining this capability with natural language processing, in
                Web 3.0, computers can distinguish information like humans in order to provide faster
                and more relevant results.
            </li>
            <li>3D Graphics - The three-dimensional design.</li>
            <li>Connectivity - the user experience evolves to another level of connectivity that
                leverages all the available information.
            </li>
            <li>Ubiquity - Content is accessible by multiple applications, every device is connected to
                the web, the services can be used everywhere.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

            <dt><u>Use Case for Web 1.0</u></dt>
            <br>
            <dd>
                Client finds a web page written by the admin.<br>
                Client reads the information.<br>
                Client leaves the page.
            </dd>
            <br>
            <dt><u>Use Case for Web 3.0</u></dt>
            <br>
            <dd>
